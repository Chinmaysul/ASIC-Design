## ASSIGNMENT 1: Compilation Of C Program and RISC-V Compilation
### Step: 1
* In the Linux Terminal, create a new C Program file. Here we have used Gedit.

```c 
#include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
    int i, n=1000, sum=0;
    for(i=1; i<n; i++){
      sum = sum + i;
    }
    printf("Sum of first 1000 numbers is %d\n",sum);
    return 0;
}
```

* Compile the code in the terminal using a compiler like GCC.

  
### Step: 2
Run the executable program using ./aout.
### Output
The picture below represents the C code and its output

### Now we will do the RISC-V compilation
### Step: 3

* Run the following command to create the object file (.o)
  ```bash
  riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum.o sum.c
  ```

### Step: 4
* Run the following command to see the instruction output in the terminal window.
  ```bash
  riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum.o|less
  ```

* For the "main" section, we can calculate the number of instructions by counting each individual instruction

* We can also find the number of instructions by subtracting the address of main with the next command
* Instructions = (00050593 - ff010113)/4 = 14 instructions
  

### Step: 5
* Now compile the code with the flag **-Ofast** while compiling

* Now we can again count the number of instructions in "main". We can observe the reduction in steps using **-Ofast**
* Instructions = (ffff0797 - 0007a5b7)/4 = 11 instructions

## ASSIGNMENT 2: RISC-V Compiler Debugging

* We will find the output of the C program on the RISC V Compiler using the Spike command to find the result of n numbers


### Step: 1
* Code for creating spike objdump file:
```bash
spike pk sum.o
```

*  We can observe the output for spike
### The compiled code using SPIKE command along with object dump file

### Step: 2
* Run this command to debug using spike
```bash
spike -d pk sum.o
```
* We will run the Spike debugger until the main function, which starts at address **100b0**. 
```bash
until pc 0 100b0
```
* After that, we manually debug the register in the next address which is the a1 register before and after the step.
```bash
reg 0 a1
```
Next, we will manually debug the next instruction i.e., addi sp, sp, -16. Before this step, the sp register shows 0x0000003ffffffb50, which then changes to 0x0000003ffffffb40.
```bash
reg 0 sp
```

## Step: 3
* The same thing happens for -O1

```bash
until pc 0 10184
reg 0 sp
```
